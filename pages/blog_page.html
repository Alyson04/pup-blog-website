    <h2> Grad school and MMDA forge partnership to enhance statistical proficiency </h2>
    <h4> Laurence P. Usona, News, Graduate School </h4>
    <p> PUP Graduate School and the Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA) have officially signed a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) aimed at bolstering statistical proficiency and leveraging data-driven decision-making to help both parties.

        The signing ceremony took place on June 4, 2024, at the Danilo Lim Conference Room, 19th floor, New MMDA Head Office Building, Julia Vargas Avenue, Pasig City. The event was attended by Dr. Ana Ruby P. Gapasin, Vice President for Research, Extension and Development, and Atty. Romando “Don” Artes, MMDA Chairman. Representatives from both PUP and MMDA were also present, heralding a new era of cooperation in statistical education and research.
        
        The collaboration will feature a range of training programs and seminars tailored to meet the needs of diverse audiences, including officials, staff, and researchers. The programs include:
        Introductory Statistical Methods
        Advanced Statistical Techniques
        Training on Statistical Software
        Applied Statistics Workshops
        Research Methodology and Data Management
        
        This partnership highlights the significance of collaboration which aims to advance statistical education and research and promoting a culture of data-driven decision-making, particularly in the field of urban planning and metropolitan development.
        The MOA includes ongoing evaluation and enhancement to ensure the programs remain relevant and effective. By pooling their expertise and resources, both institutions aim to create a robust framework for statistical training and research, ultimately contributing to more informed decision-making and improved public service.

        <h4> News, Institute of Technology </h4>
        <p>
            The Institute of Technology (ITech) successfully hosted a three-day Research Colloquium, Symposium, and Exhibit themed “Exploring Opportunities and Challenges in Emerging Technologies” from June 3-5, 2024, at the PUP Main Campus Bulwagang Balagtas, 4th floor NALRC.

Engr. Ramir M. Cruz, Dean of the Institute of Technology, opened the event with remarks that congratulated and encouraged the participants on their research endeavors. He highlighted the DEET students’ creation of a “Solar-Powered Charging Station” situated at the Institute, demonstrating the practical application of science to benefit humanity.

This aligned with the insights shared by the first day’s keynote speaker, Dr. Edison E. Mojica, Chairperson of the 
Electrical Engineering Department, College of Engineering. Dr. Mojica emphasized the power of AI in our daily lives and its intersection with sustainable consumption and production, a theme further explored by Assoc. Prof. Jimmy M. Fernando, the day two speaker, who discussed the environmental impact of technological advancements.

The event concluded with an exhibit featuring 27 booths showcasing various research projects and technological innovations. Attendees had the chance to explore these prototypes in detail, fostering a dynamic exchange of ideas and knowledge. Among the notable projects were LadderEase, Bambuyan, and Interlink. A standout project was the oil filtration method using kapok and hair, which drew significant attention for its innovative approach and practical application.

The Technology Research 2024 provided students and faculty to unveil their research and innovation to push the boundaries of technological advancement to address real-world problems efficiently.

            In a stunning display of technical innovation and creativity, the team “Diwata Overcode” from the Polytechnic University of the Philippines (PUP) emerged as champion at HackFest 2024: Fusion, organized by Google Developer Students Clubs Loyola (GDSC-L) and Globe Telecom, at the Ateneo de Manila on Saturday, May 4, 2024.

Diwata Overcode, composed of Computer Science students Xiang Cheng, Gladwin Ferdz, Infanta DelRosario, Vash Puno, and Arjay Rosel, clinched victory by developing a cutting-edge business education platform with a mobile app interface tailored to teach business concepts and ideas in a way that appeals to Gen Z, encouraging them to explore entrepreneurship as a viable career path.

“The primary reason why students struggle to become entrepreneurs is that they lack the fundamental knowledge needed to become business owners themselves. However, it goes beyond that. Our platform provides students with ways to be motivated to continue and persevere,” Del Rosario, one of the members, explained.

Furthermore, Del Rosario highlighted that the platform acts as a bridge to the business industry, empowering students to realize their entrepreneurial potential through an engaging interface tailored for Gen Z.

Throughout the 12-day competition, which featured 35 teams from across the country, Diwata Overcode navigated team-building activities and learning sessions to develop and present their solution to the hackathon challenge.

“The win means a lot to us,” Del Rosario shared.

“At first, we were intimidated by the large number of competitors and their schools, some of which had well-known names. But, later on, as we realized the potential of our skills, we were encouraged by the potential of our capabilities. This became our motivation to persevere and continue,” he added.

Joining Diwata Overcode in representing PUP, team “Iskode,” composed of computer engineering students Kyne Domerei Laggui, Amado Niño Rei Punzalan, Aira Altis Estur, and Joseph Buhain, secured fourth place.

PUP also fielded several other teams in the competition, including HGlarchies, S&T Innovatives, SSTech, and Sobrang Inet sa PUP, each contributing to the university’s strong representation

Celebrating their success, Diwata Overcode hopes their achievement will inspire fellow PUPians to participate in hackathons and similar competitions, sharing how their team’s journey from formation to reaching the top 10 highlighted their potential growth and skill development.

“When Arjay, Xian, Vash, and I (Gladwin) formed our team, we were just regular members of our organizations who joined for the experience. However, as we progressed to the top 10, we realized that we could achieve more than we initially thought, utilizing both our known skills and gaining new ones along the way,” Del Rosario said.

HackFest 2024 featured technical workshops, webinars, consultations, and a hackathon, challenging students to devise innovative solutions to the prompt, “How can we entice Gen Z budding entrepreneurs to join Amway as business owners?”
